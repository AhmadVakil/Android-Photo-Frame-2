# Android-Photo-Frame-2
Android application which helps users to add different frames to their photos.

# Progress in development
Depending on future needs this application would be changed because it's somehow incomplete with some bugs, but however main algorithms 
are almost done and it will works.

# Reason that I made this application
I made this application in few hours as an extra work to evaluate my performance within other programming languages and because 
of my interest. 

# Feel free to use the code
You can use the code for your own development or educational purposes. I will complete the code when I'm done with other works.
